# 📁 Font Server

A blazing fast, minimal font server built with raw `node:http` and `axios`.  
Includes a smart TypeScript **Google Fonts Proxy** with caching and support for **Hetzner Storage Box** (currently WIP).

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡️ Pure Node.js – no frameworks, just `node:http`
- 🧠 Google Fonts Proxy – downloads fonts on-demand and caches them locally
- 💾 File Cache – serve files instantly if already cached
- ☁️ Hetzner Storage Box integration (planned, currently not working)
- 🛠 Built with TypeScript

## 🌐 Google Fonts Proxy

Send a request like:

```
GET /fetch/inter/v13/UcC73FwrK3iLTeHuS_fvQtMwCp50KnMa1ZL7.woff2
```

The server will:
1. Check if the font is cached
2. If not, download it from Google Fonts
3. Store it locally
4. Serve it from the local cache next time 🚀
